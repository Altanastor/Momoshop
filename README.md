# Momoshop
Prototype for image post-production on top of magick. Will (likely) be part of Momacs.

Planned features :

 - Common post-production tools from `magick`: denoising, rotation, enhancements, etc.
 - Add morphological operations from `imager`
 - Returning a  pipe/function for calibrated settings
 - Writing edited files
 - Batch visualize, navigate, changes, writing
 - Merge with Momacs (acquisition part)
